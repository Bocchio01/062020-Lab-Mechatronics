## Modelling and control of a Magnetic Levitation System

This project explores traditional and modern control theory techniques to stabilize the position of a ferromagnetic ball suspended in a magnetic field generated by two electromagnets.
A "Model-based design" (MBD) approach has been adopted.

Requires:
  - Simulink
  - Coder Toolbox
  - INTECO MSL2EM Toolbox (licensed from the producer)
