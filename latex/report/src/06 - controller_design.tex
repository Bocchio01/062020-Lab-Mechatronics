\section{Controllers Design}
\label{sec:controllers_design}

In this section, we move on the design of the controllers that will be used to control the system.

As we have clarified in the previous section, the system is highly nonlinear with respect to both position and current, and we control it by acting on the input PWM signal.

In the following, we will present three main families of controllers that have been adopted for the control of the system: the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller and the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller.
For each of these controllers, we will briefly present their theoretical background, the design choices that have been made and the results that have been obtained.

The controllers have been designed and tested in simulation using the Simulink environment, and then implemented on the real system.
The results presented in this section are the one obtained from the real system, unless otherwise specified.
