\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we have presented the modelling and control of a \acrfull{mls}.
The system is composed of two electromagnets, a ferromagnetic ball and a control unit.
The goal of the system is to levitate the ball at a certain height, by controlling the current in the electromagnets.

At first, a complete model of the system has been derived, followed by the identification of its parameters.
Then, filters and estimators have been designed to estimate the state of the system, given the input and the output signals.
Finally, controllers have been designed to control the position of the ball.

The results show that the designed controllers are able to stabilize the system, and to track the desired position of the ball.
All the controllers proved to be robust to noise and model uncertainties.

In conclusion, the system has been successfully modelled and controlled, and the designed controllers are able to stabilize the system and to track the desired position of the ball.

Future work could include the design of a more advanced controller, such as Feedback Linearization or Backstepping controllers, to further improve the performance of the system in highly dynamic conditions.
