\section{Control Techniques Comparison}
\label{sec:control_techniques_comparison}

Based on the MLS2EM datasheet/manual, some suggestions are (page 5):

\begin{itemize}
    \item SISO, MISO, BIBO controllers design
    \item Intelligent/Adaptive Control
    \item Frequency analysis
    \item Nonlinear control
    \item Hardware-in-the-Loop
    \item Real-Time control
    \item Closed Loop PID Control
\end{itemize}
