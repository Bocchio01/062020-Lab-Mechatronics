\subsection{PID Controller}
\label{subsec:pid}

The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is a simple controller that uses the error signal, its history and its derivative to compute the control signal. It is a widely used controller in industry due to its simplicity and effectiveness in many applications.

\begin{equation}
    u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau)dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt} = K_p \left(e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i} \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau)dt + T_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}\right)
\end{equation}

Where $K_p$, $K_i$ and $K_d$ are the proportional, integral and derivative gains, respectively, and $T_i$ and $T_d$ are the integral and derivative time constants, respectively.
