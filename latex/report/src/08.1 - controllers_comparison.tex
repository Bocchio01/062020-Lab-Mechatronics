\subsection{Controllers comparison}
\label{subsec:controllers_comparison}

In the following sections, controllers designed in Section \ref{sec:controllers_design} are compared using different reference inputs signals.

As stated in the introduction, all the results here presented are obtained using a Kalman filter to estimate and/or filter the system's state.

\subsubsection{Multi-steps reference}
\label{subsubsec:multisteps_reference}

A sequence of equally spaced step inputs is designed to assess the controller's response to abrupt set-point changes and its steady-state performance across various set-points.

Two versions of the multi-steps reference signals are explored:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Up \& down}: signal designed to evaluate the controller's performance by moving the sphere in both directions relative to the linearization point, using steps of amplitude $2 [mm]$.
          This test assesses the controller's ability to maintain stability and accuracy during repeated set-point changes, as well as its robustness in handling deviations in both directions.
    \item \textbf{Stairs}: signal with steps always in the same direction, ranging from $8 [mm]$ to $12 [mm]$ with a resolution of $1 [mm]$.
          This test is particularly useful for analyzing the controller's response to minor perturbations and its capacity for gradual positional adjustments.
\end{itemize}

The following figures show the comparison of the controllers using the multi-steps reference signals.

\paragraph{PID anti-windup}

The PID anti-windup controller exhibits the response that deviates the most from the reference data compared to the other developed controllers.

The trajectory presents an overshoot before the sphere approaches the correct value.
This behavior clearly delays the achievement of the reference position.
In fact the sphere reaches the reference position just in time before it is changed.

The control exhibits numerous oscillations and peaks, particularly during transitions.

The slowness in approaching the target position makes the PID anti-windup unsuitable for rapid reference changes.

\paragraph{PID gain scheduling}

According to the theory, the performance of the PID, is significantly enhanced by the development of PID gain scheduling.

Using multiple linearization, it enables a much more accurate trajectory of the sphere, free from overshoots and considerably faster.

Additionally, the control behavior in the case of PID gain scheduling is cleaner respect to the anti-windup case, but not respect to the other controllers.

The effectiveness of PID gain scheduling is limited by the linearity of the model: in the presence of non-linearities or complex dynamics, it cannot compete with advanced techniques such as LQR or LQI.

\paragraph{LQR tracking}

The LQR tracking controller exhibits reduced error during the transient phase, with small oscillations as the set points are reached.
In steady state, the error is small, but the accuracy can be enhanced by the use of LQI controller.
A small overshoot peak is observed prior to stabilization.

Dynamically, the response is very fast, demonstrating that LQR tracking is the quickest controller among those implemented.

The control behavior is highly smooth and significantly outperforms both the PID anti-windup and the PID gain scheduling.
The control signal presents some peaks during the steps, but they remain well-contained.

The small oscillations observed are due to the lack of an integral component, which does not allow to completely cancel constant errors.

\paragraph{LQI}

The LQI controller, leveraging its integral term, compensates the accumulated error over time.
In steady state, the sphere approaches the reference trajectory with smaller discrepancy compared to the LQR tracking case.

Dynamically, the transitions are less aggressive, and the overshoot is reduced, at the cost of a slightly increased stabilization time.

The control exhibits small fluctuations and avoids the peaks observed in the tracking case.
The LQI control establishes itself as the cleanest control signal, as demonstrated in all the figures above.

The slower stabilization is a consequence of the more controlled and less aggressive dynamics compared to LQR.

Compared to the LQR, the LQI is particularly suitable for applications where stability and accuracy are more important than response speed.

\paragraph{MPC}

The MPC exhibits a more oscillatory behavior compared to LQR or LQI, with pronounced oscillations during set point transitions.
These oscillations are particularly noticeable at reference step changes.

In steady-state conditions, the MPC sufficiently reduces the error, stabilizing more slowly than LQI and PID gain scheduling, but faster than the PID anti-windup.

The MPC is more aggressive in attempting to reach the set point.

The control graph shows oscillations and peaks during position changes, which remain contained.

The MPC control is less smooth than LQI and LQR tracking but is better respect both the PID controllers.
MPC is best suited for complex, multivariable scenarios, but in cases with rapid transitions it may be less smooth than LQR and LQI.



\subsubsection{Sinusoidal (discrete) reference}
\label{subsubsec:sinusoidal_discrete_reference}

As a second reference signal for the comparison of the controllers, we propose the sinusoidal (discrete) reference.

Here the input signal is a sinusoidal shape, but represented as a sequence of discrete steps.
The period on the sinusoidal is 2 seconds, and the amplitude is $2 [mm]$ centered around $10 [mm]$.

The following figures show the comparison of the controllers using the sinusoidal reference signals.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{PID anti-windup}

As with the multistep reference, in the case of the fast sine reference, the PID anti-windup controller proves to be the least effective.
The nature of the PID and the inability to anticipate dynamics make it difficult to manage a rapidly varying trajectory such as a stepped sine.

It deviates from the desired trajectory much more significantly compared to the other controllers developed and exhibits greater oscillations, particularly when the sphere is closer to the upper coil.

The control performance is also the worst when compared to the other controllers, with large oscillations at the extreme points of the sine wave.

\paragraph{PID gain scheduling}

The PID gain scheduling significantly reduces oscillations of the trajectory, as observed in the multistep reference, demonstrating a much better performance than the anti-windup case.
However, it still shows oscillations, particularly when the sphere reaches a distance of 8 mm from the upper coil.

The control remains really inadequate with large oscillations, in particular at the extreme points of the sinusoidal.

\paragraph{LQR tracking}

The LQR tracking is highly accurate, with the trajectory closely following the reference and exhibiting small oscillations.
The control is much improved, without saturation and very low oscillations.


\paragraph{LQI}

The LQI, thanks to its integral term, is able to follow the reference even more precisely than the LQR tracking.
It once again proves to be the best controller for achieving an accurate and fast response with very clean control.

The control signal is smooth, without peaks or large oscillations.
The fast sine reference demonstrates the great performance of this controller.
The LQI is able to manage not only the dynamic trajectory, but also to maintain a practically zero error at steady state, proving to be the cleanest and most stable.

\paragraph{MPC}

Despite some trajectory delay due to prediction calculations, the MPC is able to follow the reference, proving to be a sufficient controller even for a fast dynamic system like this one.

The control exhibits several peaks, but they are always well contained.
As it was written for the multistep case, MPC is best suited for complex, multivariable scenarios, but in this case the performance is inferior respect to LQR tracking and LQI.



\subsubsection{Conclusions}
\label{subsubsec:conclusions_controllers_comparison}

The comparative analysis of the controllers reveals significant differences in performance across various scenarios.

The PID anti-windup controller is the least effective, exhibiting slow and oscillatory behavior with a noticeable delay in reaching the reference position. It struggles to maintain trajectory adherence and minimize oscillations, particularly at smaller distances from the upper coil.

The PID gain scheduling improves performance compared to the PID anti-windup by reducing overshoot and increasing response speed. However, it still suffers from large oscillations and peaks in the control signal, making it unsuitable for this system.

The LQR tracking controller provides faster responses with minimal error and exhibits a clean control signal, making it an effective solution for precise and rapid adjustments.

The LQI controller offers the best performance overall, combining stability, accuracy, and clean control. It achieves a more stable response with fewer oscillations compared to the LQR and other controllers, making it the most consistent and reliable choice for this study.

The MPC controller, while more aggressive, demonstrates adequate tracking of the reference. However, it introduces oscillations during reference changes, resulting in less smooth control compared to other methods. Additionally, its performance is hindered by delays from prediction calculations, highlighting the need for further tuning and optimization.

In summary, the LQI controller stands out as the optimal solution for precise, rapid, and smooth control, delivering the most consistent performance across all tests.
