\section{Controllers Design}
\label{sec:controllers_design}

\hl{We need to state clearly that we are not using the lower electromagnets for control purposes.}

In this section, we move onto the design of the controllers that will be used to control the system.

As we have clarified in the previous modelling section (Section \ref{sec:modelling}), the system is highly nonlinear with respect to both position and current, and we control it by acting on the input PWM signal.

In the following, we will present three main families of controllers that have been adopted for the control of the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PID Controllers}: a simple controller that uses the error signal, its history and derivative to compute the control signal (Section \ref{subsec:pid_controllers})
    \item \textbf{LQR Controllers}: a controller that minimizes a quadratic cost function to compute the control signal (Section \ref{subsec:lq_controllers})
    \item \textbf{MPC Controllers}: a controller that predicts the future evolution of the system and computes the control signal by minimizing a cost function (Section \ref{subsec:mpc_controllers})
\end{itemize}

For each of these controllers, we will briefly present their theoretical background and the design choices that have been made.

Results and comparisons between the different controllers will be presented in the next section (Section \ref{sec:results}).
