\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

To thoroughly assess the performance of the controllers and estimators \& filters, several reference signals were designed to evaluate different aspects of system dynamics, including transient response, steady-state behavior, adaptability, and robustness.

In the following sections, we propose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Controllers comparison}: a comparison between PIDs, LQs and MPC controllers as designed in Section \ref{sec:controllers_design}. Results are obtained using Kalman filters to estimate and/or filter the system's state.
    \item \textbf{Filters comparison}: a comparison between the filters designed in Section \ref{sec:filters_estimators_design}. Results are obtained using an LQR tracking controller to evaluate the observer's ability to track the system's state during continuous oscillatory motion.
\end{itemize}
