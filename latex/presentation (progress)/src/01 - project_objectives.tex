\begin{frame}{Magnetic Levitation System (MLS)}

    Magnetic Levitation System (MLS), also known as MagLev, is a highly nonlinear system that can be used to study control strategies.
    It's composed of two electromagnets that are driven in voltage to generate a magnetic field in order levitates a metallic ball sitting in between them.
