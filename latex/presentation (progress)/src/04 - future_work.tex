\section{Future work}

\begin{frame}{What we want to achieve?}
\textbf{Other Controllers:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Controllers}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Model Predictive Control (MPC)
        \item Cascaded Control
        \item Adaptive MPC
        \item Pole Placement
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Nonlinear Controllers}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Backstepping
        \item Feedback Linearization
        \item Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We want to understand if the discretization of controllers is important in our case of study and how to achieve it

\begin{frame}{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discretization}: Describe the discretization process applied to continuous-time systems. How does discretization affect the system model and its subsequent analysis?

    \item \textbf{MPC Linearization}: Problems of linearization within Model Predictive Control (MPC).
    
    \item \textbf{Use of a Single Coil}: Discuss the implications and limitations of using a single coil in the system.

    \item \textbf{Neglecting the Influence of Current on Inductance in the Model}: Justify the assumption of neglecting the influence of current on inductance in the model. Under what conditions can this simplification be considered accurate?

\end{enumerate}
