  title     = {Design of an Electromagnetic Setup for Independent Three-Dimensional Control of Pairs of Identical and Nonidentical Microrobots},
  abstract  = {Independent control of microrobots is a cardinal challenge for manipulation at micro/nano scale. In this paper, we design and assemble an electromagnetic setup to overcome some of the major obstacles in the independent control of microrobots. The demanding magnetic requirements are met by the presented experimental testbed that is able to produce magnetic fields and gradients of, respectively, 160 mT and 3.6 T/m at the center of the workspace. Through the design process of this testbed, we analyze the importance of design parameters and derive a quantitative analysis of the requirements for the dissipation of the generated heat. Further, we present and develop the model and software infrastructure, capable of running at 25 Hz, necessary for independent control of multiple microrobots. We also introduce two novel techniques for current-minimizing mapping of the desired forces into currents at the electromagnet. Finally, the capabilities of the setup are demonstrated through independent control of two, both identical and nonidentical, soft-magnetic microspheres in three-dimensional space—with average root mean square errors of 102 μ m and peak velocities of up to 331 μ m/s.},

  abstract = {Untethered, controllable, mobile microrobots have been proposed for numerous applications, ranging from micro-manipulation, in vitro tasks (e.g., operation of microscale biological substances) to in vivo applications (e.g., targeted drug delivery; brachytherapy; hyperthermia, etc.), due to their small-scale dimensions and accessibility to tiny and complex environments. Researchers have used different magnetic actuation systems allowing custom-designed workspace and multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) to actuate microrobots with various motion control methods from open-loop pre-programmed control to closed-loop path-following control. This article provides an overview of the magnetic actuation systems and the magnetic actuation-based control methods for microrobots. An overall benchmark on the magnetic actuation system and control method is also discussed according to the applications of microrobots.},

  abstract = {Low-gravity environment can have a profound impact on the behaviors of biological systems, the dynamics of fluids, and the growth of materials. Systematic research on the effects of gravity is crucial for advancing our knowledge and for the success of space missions. Due to the high cost and the limitations in the payload size and mass in typical spaceflight missions, ground-based low-gravity simulators have become indispensable for preparing spaceflight experiments and for serving as stand-alone research platforms. Among various simulator systems, the magnetic levitation-based simulator (MLS) has received long-lasting interest due to its easily adjustable gravity and practically unlimited operation time. However, a recognized issue with MLSs is their highly non-uniform force field. For a solenoid MLS, the functional volume V1{\%}, where the net force results in an acceleration <1{\%} of the Earth's gravity g, is typically a few microliters ($\mu$L) or less. In this work, we report an innovative MLS design that integrates a superconducting magnet with a gradient-field Maxwell coil. Through an optimization analysis, we show that an unprecedented V1{\%} of over 4000{\thinspace}$\mu$L can be achieved in a compact coil with a diameter of 8{\thinspace}cm. We also discuss how such an MLS can be made using existing high-Tc-superconducting materials. When the current in this MLS is reduced to emulate the gravity on Mars (gM{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.38g), a functional volume where the gravity varies within a few percent of gM can exceed 20,000{\thinspace}$\mu$L. Our design may break new ground for future low-gravity research.},

  abstract = {Abstract All matter has density. The recorded uses of density to characterize matter date back to as early as ca. 250 BC, when Archimedes was believed to have solved “The Puzzle of The King's Crown” using density.[1] Today, measurements of density are used to separate and characterize a range of materials (including cells and organisms), and their chemical and/or physical changes in time and space. This Review describes a density-based technique—magnetic levitation (which we call “MagLev” for simplicity)—developed and used to solve problems in the fields of chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry. MagLev has two principal characteristics—simplicity, and applicability to a wide range of materials—that make it useful for a number of applications (for example, characterization of materials, quality control of manufactured plastic parts, self-assembly of objects in 3D, separation of different types of biological cells, and bioanalyses). Its simplicity and breadth of applications also enable its use in low-resource settings (for example—in economically developing regions—in evaluating water/food quality, and in diagnosing disease).},
